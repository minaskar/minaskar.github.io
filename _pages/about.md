I am currently a Postodoctoral Fellow at the Berkeley Center for Cosmological Physics at
University of California, Berkeley.

My research focuses on the applications of Bayesian probability theory in astronomy
and the development of open source scientific software.

I received my PhD in Astrophysics in 2022 under the supervision of Florian Beutler and
John A. Peacock in the Royal Observatory at the University of Edinburgh. My doctoral thesis
was titled *Bayesian Computation in Astronomy: Novel methods for parallel and gradient-free
inference* and is available [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.16134.pdf).
